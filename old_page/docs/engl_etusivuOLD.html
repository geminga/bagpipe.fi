Welcome to the homepage of the Helsinki Pipes and Drums, the oldest, finest and only Pipe Band in Finland. We practise on Mondays, from 
6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Alppila, Helsinki. Contact us for details. 
</P>

<b>About us</b>
<P>
The band, which was previously known as the MacGregor Highlanders, was founded in 1991, and was at the time 
under the leadership of John MacGregor. The Band's second P/M was Gustav Henriksson, who succeeded John after 
he moved to Tallinn in September 1997. After Gustav moved to Sweden in September 2000, Annukka Matilainen took 
over as P/M. Eevastiina Korri is the current Pipe Major, since 1.2.2006.
</p>

<p>
We're probably the northernmost pipe band in the world!!!
</P>

<P>
At present the Band has 6 pipers and 3 drummers who perform in public. We 
welcome new students to join the band!
</p>

<p>The uniform 
currently worn by the band is MacKintosh tartan kilts and ties, black Argyll jacket and ditto Glengarry. Black 
Watch is worn by the drummers.
</p>
<b>Performances and competitions</b>
<p>
Performances so far range from neighbourhood parades and performances to several appearances at the Kaustinen 
Folk Music Festival, performances in Long Island Highland Games, New York U.S.A., Oulu Highland Games for Eurosport 
sports channel and 
Tallinn, Estonia. We have also performed repeatedly at the Hamina Tattoo, a Finnish military 
tattoo held every two years in Hamina, a small town a few hours drive east of Helsinki.</p>

<p>
As far as the competition scene goes, some of us 
have participated in the Copenhagen Winter Championships (CWC), held in February, and the 
Scandinavian Piping 
Championships in May, also held 
in Copenhagen. In SCOC 1999 HelPD took part in March grade IV and came in 3rd! We also took all in all 8 solo 
top3-positions! In SCOC 2000 only one piper took part and won March 2/4 Intermediate 
piping. 2002 World Pipe Band Championships and the 2003 European championships have also 
had players from our band, as members of other Scandinavian bands. 2005 Scandinavian Pipe Band Champions, <a 
href="http://www.sackpipa.com" target="_blank">PD1RE</a> had two members from Helsinki Pipes and Drums when winning, 
D/Sgt Manne Laukkanen in the drum core and former pipe major Gustav Henriksson in the pipe core.</P>

<b>Order us to perform</b> (Finland and the Baltic region)
<p>The band can be ordered to perform in larger or smaller events. You can hire us in many configurations: as a band, as a quintet, trio, duo (for 
example a piper and a drummer) or a single solo piper. We always perform dressed in traditional Scottish attire. We play the traditional tunes 
like <em>Black Bear, Scotland the Brave, Amazing Grace, Misty Mountains, Highland Cathedral</em> and much much more. We also have a wide repertoire of 
faster up-tempo songs in <em>hornpipe, jig, march, strathspey</em> and <em>reel</em> styles.</p>

<p>In performances we can, besides playing, tell about Scottish piping culture, history of the bagpipes, teach some simple Scottish dances, lead a 
parade from one place to another...you are free to come up with ideas.</p>

<p>You can order us to perform in Finland and the Baltic Sea region by e-mailing to <b>keikkamyynti(at)bagpipe.fi</b>. (Replace the (at) with @).</p>
