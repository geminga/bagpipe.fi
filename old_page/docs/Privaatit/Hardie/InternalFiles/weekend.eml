Hi Eevastiina and Manne,

thanks for the weekend. I really enjoied the weekend in finland. Hope you 
got something good out of the it aswell.

Just remembered that Manne talked about "designing the season". Like you 
(evis) said we have different goals for our bands and it makes it difficult 
to adopt the way we do it in stockholm. But I just thougt, why not just 
wright down how I plan the season. You can rearrange it your way and use 
what you want and what you find fits your band.

The season ends and next one starts in september. (We often have a break for 
a month after the worlds which is in the middle of august.)

At that time I deside what tunes we need to add/change/take away from the 
standard repertoir. So from the end of september we start with learning the 
new tunes. The pipes oftern sound very well at this time so we have one hour 
PC and 1,5 hours Pipes (and drums). And, like I wrote - pipes for a few 
minutes, PC, then back to the pipes.

Christmas ruins all the good sound and spirit. :-) Christmasholiday, food 
and vodka keeps people away from the practices...

At christmas-new year I deside what tunes we are going to compete with.

Then at the worst piping period (dry, cold...) we play much more PC than 
Pipe.
Jan-Mar - practice competition sets.
As we learn more and more of the sets, we play more pipes. In the middle of 
april
we play very little PC (if any at all).

At this time everybody should know both the competition sets and the new 
standard. As a remark - I change very little in the standard every year. For 
example this season I
1) added a slow air,
2) changed one set (kept only one tune, changed the rest)
3) added a hornpipe to another hornpipe

Approx two month before the Scandinavian Camp. we start with two practices a 
week.
No PC only pipes.

Thats roughly it. And this is what I'm aiming for, but it doesn't allway 
work. This year I had our competing MSR ready at christmas, but the medley 
about february. :-)

If you have any questions/thoughts don't hesitate to send me an e-mail or 
give me a call.

Regards,
Krister
