Kaija: Pure huulta ja koita kestää taivaasta satava sentimentaalinen siirappi

When the sun goes down on the dark side with your friends so far away
All alone in a crowd with your heart so proud as the pipes begin to play 
When you hear those drums in the distance will your soul lift up and sing
With the brim of the ?nt does your heart still part when the pipes begin to play and the drum beats far away

For you know your love is in Scotland even though you're old and gray, 
by the right you will stand when you hear the command 
and the pipes begin to play and the drum beats far away

To the friends who share in your memories to the love that's lost it's way 
for you know in your heart that you will cry at the part when the pipes begin to play 
be joys be tears they have served through the years when the drum beats far away and the pipes begin to play.
