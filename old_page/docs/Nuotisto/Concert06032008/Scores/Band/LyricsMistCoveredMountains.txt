Chorus
Oh ro soon shall I see them oh;
Oh he ro see them oh see them oh.
Oh ro soon shall I see them the
mist covered mountains of home.

There shall I visit the place of my birth again
they'll give me welcome the warmest on earth again
loving and kind, full of music and mirth in the
sweet sounding language of home.

Oh ro soon shall I see them oh;
Oh he ro see them oh see them oh.
Oh ro soon shall I see them the
mist covered mountains of home.

There shall I gaze on the mountains of mine again,
fields and the woods and the burns and the glens again,
Away 'mong the corries beyond the human ken
In the haunts of the deer I will roam

Chorus
Oh ro soon shall I see them oh;
Oh he ro see them oh see them oh.
Oh ro soon shall I see them the
mist covered mountains of home.

Hail to the mountains with summits of blue, to the
glens with their meadows of sunshine and dew, to the
women and men ever constant and true, Ever ready to welcome one home.

Oh ro soon shall I see them oh;
Oh he ro see them oh see them oh.
Oh ro soon shall I see them the
mist covered mountains of home.
