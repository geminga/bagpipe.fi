<h1>WANT TO LEARN TO PLAY SNARE/TENOR/BASS DRUM?</h1>

<P>
Wanna start a new hobby? Interested in Celtic music?<BR>
Start playing Scottish DRUMS!
</P>

<P>
Scottish pipe band drumming is arguably the most challenging and groovy of all military-related snare drumming styles. 
It's hip-hoppish rhythms have you playing quintruplets so groovily no-one even notices the technical subtleties.
</P>

<P>
The teacher for new drumming pupils is Manne Laukkanen. A few times a year we have some foreign teachers over for 
workshops. 
If you're interested in taking drumming lessons and later join the band, just email Manne 
Laukkanen: manne(at)iki.fi

The band has rehearsals once a week in Helsinki. Besides practising we also know how to have a good time!
