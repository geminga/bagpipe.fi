<p>Thank you for Your interest in our bagpipe band, <a 
href="http://www.bagpipe.fi/engl_index.html" 
name="Helsinki Pipes and Drums" type="text/html" target="_blank">The Helsinki Pipes and Drums</a>.</p>
<p>We offer the following for your Highland bagpipe music needs:
<ul>
<li>A piper and a drummer of highest quality in Finland dressed in Scottish Highland 
attire.</li>
<li>Two 15-30 min Performances, one at 15:45 and one later in the evening on both days.</li>
<li>Information about Scottish bagpipe music in the breaks between playing if You so wish.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To make this happen, we would require the following:
<ul>
<li>Tickets for traveling to Tallinn on the 12th and back to Helsinki on the 13th or 14th with a day ferry, so that we don't have to spend the night on the ferry. It would be most convenient if the tickets could be bought by You and put under the name Manne Laukkanen for the office of the ship company in Finland for the day of the departure.</li>
<li>Two single rooms in a good quality lodging preferably close to, or within, the Tallinn city center. 
These rooms should be in our use from the time of at least two hours prior the first performance, and at least two hours after the last performance and the nights spent in Tallinn for the performances.
<br>If the time of the last performance will require us to spend also the other night in Tallinn, we would need to have the room for the night of 13-14.1.2005 as well.
</li>
<li>Breakfast and meals, preferably also drinks during the days spent in Tallinn.</li>
<li>50 &euro; per player per day, this will form the total of 200 &euro; for the performances mentioned. (50 &euro; x 2 players x 2 days) </li>
<li>A place close to or within the places of performance where we can tune and warm up for an hour or so, prior to performance. This will lead to You getting a better quality playing from us, since the instruments, and we, will be in good tune.</li>
<li>The piper needs a bottle of water for the time of playing due to dehydration caused by the playing.</li>
</ul>
I hope you won't feel our requirements too demanding. The standard price for performances in 
Finland is 200 &euro; per person plus travel and food, thus making the aforementioned actually quite a 
bargain. </p>
<p>Due to the risk of breakage of the expensive instruments we cannot play outside if the temperature is below 
zero.</p>
<p>We are very eager to visit your beautiful city and aim on giving you the best of performances if you easen our work by helping us out with the wishes presented above.</p>
<p>For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me by e-mail at the mail address: <b>info(at)bagpipe.fi</b>. (Replace (at) with the symbol @). Also, John MacGregor knows my phone number, if that is needed.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,
<br>Manne Laukkanen (D/Sgt),
<br>The Helsinki Pipes and Drums
