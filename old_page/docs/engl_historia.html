<p>
Helsinki Pipes and Drums, originally &quot;The MacGregor Highlanders&quot;,
was founded in 1991 by John MacGregor of the clan MacIntosh.
The band included some professional musicians with high musical
skills in its ranks right from the start, thus achieving an average level of playing quite quickly.
</p>

<p>
Under John's period as a Pipe Major, the band developed from an upstart band to a pipe band with
international contacts and knowledge of the playing skills required for a pipe band. The band visited
e.g. Long Island Highland Games in New York, U.S.A and formed contacts with the Scandinavian piping community.
</p>

<p>
In 1997 the band changed its name to Helsinki Pipes and Drums on the eve of John's departure to Tallinn,
Estonia, where he still teaches young pipers in addition to pursuing a career in the restaurant business.
</p>

<p>In 1998 John was replaced by P/M (Pipe Major) Gustav Henriksson, who 
gracefully led the band to its first international competition, and major 
concert. The band lost him in the year 2001,
when he moved to Sweden. In 2002 Gustav Henriksson was replaced by P/M, Ms. 
Annukka Matilainen, another product of the tuition of HelPD members and guest 
teachers, who in turn was replaced by Eevastiina Korri in January 
2006...and Annukka Matilainen again from 2008 onwards.
</p>

<p>
Lineup of the band consists now of 6 pipers, two snare drummers, one of 
which is also a 
bass drummer, when need be.
Older band members have students under tuition.
<br>
</p>

<p>
The band practises regularly, and has during the years performed in TV and several music-festivals, including:

A significant part of the education and cultural activity of the group is done together with other
pipe bands from Scandinavia.

 (Denmark) have been especially close, as members of the Helsinki Pipes and Drums have performed
in Sweden, Sicily, Malta, Belgium, Denmark and Scotland with the aforementioned bands.
</p>

<p>The band has imported teachers from Sweden, Denmark, Scotland and New Zealand
to educate them further in piping and drumming - master classes by foreign teachers are 
preferred, as piping culture in Finland is still relatively young.
</p>

<p>
Members of the band have taken part in several master classes and competitions during the last years.
<br>The bands competing premiere in 2001 gave them third place in the band competition of their series,
as well as eight prizes in solo competitions. This should be considered as a success of sorts, as this was the bands
(and its members) first competition ever.
</p>

<p>Band members have already also taken part in other competitions of high level, like the European Championships 
and the great of the greats, The World Pipe Band Championships.
2002 WPBC saw its first Finnish competitor in the Glasgow Green, in Grade 2 with the 1:st Royal Engineers of 
Stockholm. The band was eighth in its heat.
</p>

<p>The bands repertoire is mainly traditional Scottish Pipe Band music, with a hint of the modern.
Typical sets include Scottish marches and slow airs, as well as strathspeys, reels, jigs and hornpipes.
 Band also likes to add tonal breadth to their sound, celtic fusion songs by Dan-Ar-Braz and others have been performed
 with modern pop-bands consisting of keyboards, drum-kit, electric guitar and the like.
</p>

<p>
Performances are formed to suit the occasion, all wishes of the client are considered and acted upon.
<br>If you seek to order us, we kindly request you to consider the following suggestion as the basic form for the
performance of the evening:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
To maintain the interest of the audience, it is worth considering to have shortish (5-15 min) sets, which are
then performed 1-2 times in an hour. This also makes it possible to have the instruments well in tune - climate and
air humidity are known to affect the tuning of the pipes.
</ul>
</p>

<p>The band always performs in traditional Scottish attire, and follows the 
formal customs of pipe band performances.
When the band is not playing or tuning, the audience has ample chance for conversations about Scottish music and
Scottish culture - everything we know, we are more than willing to pass on.
</p>

<p>
The bands main goals currently are to build the bands numbers and achieve a 
higher level of playing skill.
