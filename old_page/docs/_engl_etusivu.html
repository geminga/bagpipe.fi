Welcome
	to the homepage of the Helsinki Pipes and Drums, the oldest, finest
	and only <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipes_and_drums" TARGET="_blank">Pipe
	Band</A> in Finland. We practise on <EM>Thursdays</EM>, from 6 p.m.
	to 8 p.m. at Lauttasaari church, Helsinki. Contact us for details. 
	</P>
	<P><B>About us</B> 
	</P>
	<P>The band, which was previously known as the MacGregor
	Highlanders, was founded in 1991, and was at the time under the
	leadership of John MacGregor. The Band's second P/M was Gustav
	Henriksson, who succeeded John after he moved to Tallinn in
	September 1997. After Gustav moved to Sweden in September 2000,
	Annukka Matilainen took over as P/M.</P>
	<P>We're probably the northernmost pipe band in the world!!! 
	</P>
	<P>At present the Band has 6 pipers and 3 drummers who perform in
	public. We welcome new students to join the band! 
	</P>
	<P>The uniform currently worn by the band is MacKintosh tartan kilts
	and ties, black Argyll jacket and ditto Glengarry. Black Watch is
	worn by the drummers. 
	</P>
	<P><B>Performances and competitions</B> 
	</P>
	<P>Performances so far range from neighbourhood parades and
	performances to several appearances at the Kaustinen Folk Music
	Festival, performances in St. Patrick's Day parade 2009 and Long Island Highland Games, New York
	U.S.A., Oulu Highland Games for Eurosport sports channel and
	Tallinn, Estonia. We have also performed repeatedly at the Hamina
	Tattoo, a Finnish military tattoo held every two years in Hamina, a
	small town a few hours drive east of Helsinki.</P>
	<P>As far as the competition scene goes, some of us have
	participated in the Copenhagen Winter Championships (CWC), held in
	February, and the Scandinavian Piping Championships in May, also
	held in Copenhagen. In SCOC 1999 HelPD took part in March grade IV
	and came in 3rd! We also took all in all 8 solo top3-positions! In
	SCOC 2000 only one piper took part and won March 2/4 Intermediate
	piping. 2002 World Pipe Band Championships and the 2003 European
	championships have also had players from our band, as members of
	other Scandinavian bands. 2005 Scandinavian Pipe Band Champions,
	<A HREF="http://www.sackpipa.com/" TARGET="_blank">PD1RE</A> had two
	members from Helsinki Pipes and Drums when winning, D/Sgt Manne
	Laukkanen in the drum core and former pipe major Gustav Henriksson
	in the pipe core.</P>
	<P><B>Order us to perform</B> (Finland and the Baltic region) 
	</P>
	<P>The band can be ordered to perform in larger or smaller events.
	You can hire us in many configurations: as a band, as a quintet,
	trio, duo (for example a piper and a drummer) or a single solo
	piper. We always perform dressed in traditional Scottish attire. We
	play the traditional tunes like <EM>Black Bear, Scotland the Brave,
	Amazing Grace, Misty Mountains, Highland Cathedral</EM> and much
	much more. We also have a wide repertoire of faster up-tempo songs
	in <EM>hornpipe, jig, march, strathspey</EM> and <EM>reel</EM>
	styles.</P>
	<P>In performances we can, besides playing, tell about Scottish
	piping culture, history of the bagpipes, teach some simple Scottish
	dances, lead a parade from one place to another...you are free to
	come up with ideas.</P>
	<P>You can order us to perform in Finland and the Baltic Sea region
	by e-mailing to <B>keikkamyynti(at)bagpipe.fi</B>. (Replace the (at)
	with @).</P>
	<P>P.S. <BR>A frequently asked question: <BR><I>&quot;The piper
	would only need to play a tune or two, can I get them at half the
	price?&quot;</I>. <BR>No, regrettably not. <BR>Reason: A performance
	at your event by us actually consists of: 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Years of dedicated practise and
		study without a nickel of income from it. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Expensive maintenance of
		instrument and uniform. Expensive, all parts have to be imported to
		Finland. Also teachers. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Practising to fulfill the
		particular wishes by You, the customer. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Tuning the instrument, dressing
		up and travelling to the place. 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Actually
		performing at Your event, dressed sharp, in tune and in shape to
		play.</FONT> 
		</P>
		<LI><P>Travelling back, maintaining the instrument, undressing and
		going about our normal duties. 
		</P>
	</UL>
	<P>We are extremely grateful for your interest in us and will
	perform for you gladly. However, from the above list you get a
	picture of what goes behind the scenes, and why playing 2 tunes
	instead of 4 really does not make any difference to our workload. 
	</P>
